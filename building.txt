Prerequisits:
- The current folder should be named "vcxsrv"
- Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition
- Strawberry perl portable edition installed in c:\perl
- Cygwin (install the required tools when errors seen: nasm, flex, bison, python2, python2-mako, python3, python3-lxml, gperf, dos2unix, find....)
- To build the installer: nsis

You should call buildall.sh script from a cygwin shell, NOT in an ADMIN shell

Run buildall.sh 1 9 to build the 64-bit version and buildall.sh 0 9 for the 32-bit.
(The second number on the command line is the number of parallel processes to use)

You can call buildall.sh 1 9 --unix if you have some issues building the project.
This will change all the \r\n end of line into \n
