------------------------------------------------

The Aziugo team manages a forked version off VcXsrv.

VcXsrv is a Windows X-server based on the xorg git sources (like xming or cygwin's xwin), but compiled with Visual Studio.

The upstream VcXsrv project can be found on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/). 

The purpose of this version is to provide a way to specify AppUserModelId for MS Windows 7+
